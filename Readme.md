# YOUR PROJECT TITLE: SOUL COLLECTOR.
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/fStZSqNvVGE>

#### Description:

As my final project for the CS50x course, I created a game using the Unity game engine. In this game, you have 50 seconds to collect wandering souls while avoiding dark souls. You can move using the AWSD or arrow keys and collect souls by pressing the left shift key when you are near them.
Installation

To run the game, you will need to have Unity installed on your computer. Once you have Unity installed, you can download the project files from the GitHub repository and open the project in Unity.
Usage

The game is played using the AWSD or arrow keys to move and the left shift key to collect souls. The objective of the game is to collect as many wandering souls as possible within 50 seconds while avoiding dark souls. The game ends when the timer runs out or when you collide with a dark soul.
Files

The project contains the following files:

    Player: Responsible for player inputs and animations.
    Killer: Responsible for dark souls movements and animations.
    WanderingSoul: Responsible for wandering souls movements and animations.
    LevelManager: Responsible for menu buttons.
    Finish: Responsible for finish line.
    Result: Responsible for different results.
    Timer: Responsible for game timer.
    ParallaxBackground: Responsible for the parallax background.

Design Choices

I used free asset packs for this project, including Unity free assets: Text Mesh Pro and Cinemachine, and some Soul and Witcher free sprites. I chose these assets because they were free and provided the necessary functionality for the game.
Conclusion
