# PROJECT TITLE: SOUL COLLECTOR.
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/drKUO8ZIrSI>

#### Description:

For my final project in the CS50x course, I developed an engaging and challenging game titled “SOUL COLLECTOR”, using the powerful Unity game engine.

In “SOUL COLLECTOR”, the player is thrust into a mystical world where souls wander aimlessly. The primary objective of the game is to collect these wandering souls within a span of 50 seconds. However, the task is not as simple as it seems. Lurking among the wandering souls are dark souls that the player must avoid at all costs. A single touch with these dark souls can end the game prematurely, adding a layer of complexity and thrill to the gameplay.

The player navigates this world using the AWSD or arrow keys. When the player is near a wandering soul, they can collect it by pressing the left shift key. This mechanic introduces a strategic element to the game, as the player must decide when to collect souls while avoiding the dark souls.

Installation:
To experience “SOUL COLLECTOR”, you will first need to have Unity installed on your computer. Unity is a cross-platform game engine that allows you to run games like “SOUL COLLECTOR”. Once Unity is installed, you can download the project files from the GitHub repository. After downloading, simply open the project in Unity, and you’re ready to start playing!

Usage:
Playing “SOUL COLLECTOR” is straightforward yet challenging. You move using the AWSD or arrow keys and collect souls by pressing the left shift key when you are near them. The goal is to collect as many wandering souls as possible within the 50-second time limit while avoiding the dark souls. The game concludes when the timer runs out or when you collide with a dark soul, whichever comes first.

Files:
The project is composed of several files, each serving a specific purpose:

Player: Handles player inputs and animations.
Killer: Manages the movements and animations of the dark souls.
WanderingSoul: Controls the movements and animations of the wandering souls.
LevelManager: Handles the functionality of menu buttons.
Finish: Manages the finish line.
Result: Determines different results based on player performance.
Timer: Keeps track of the game timer.
ParallaxBackground: Creates the parallax effect for the background.
Design Choices:
For this project, I utilized free asset packs, including Unity’s free assets: Text Mesh Pro and Cinemachine, along with some free sprites of Souls and Witchers. These assets were chosen due to their cost-effectiveness and their ability to provide the necessary functionality for the game.

Conclusion:
I sincerely hope you enjoy playing “SOUL COLLECTOR”. It was a joy to create, and I believe it offers a unique and engaging gaming experience. If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please feel free to contact me. Your input is greatly appreciated and will help improve “SOUL COLLECTOR” for all players. Happy gaming!
