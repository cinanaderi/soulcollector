# SOUL COLLECTOR
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/fStZSqNvVGE>
#### Description: As my final project for the CS50x course, I created a game using the Unity game engine. In this game, you have 50 seconds to collect wandering souls while avoiding dark souls. You can move using the AWSD or arrow keys and collect souls by pressing the left shift key when you are near them.
